## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/password-operator:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/password-operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster

### Test It Out

1. Start kind cluster

    ```sh
    kind create cluster
    ```

1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

    ```sh
    make install
    ```

1. Run cert manager

    ```
    CERT_MANAGER_VERSION=v1.8.0
    kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/$CERT_MANAGER_VERSION/cert-manager.yaml
    ```

1. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

    ```sh
    IMG=password-operator:webhook
    make docker-build IMG=$IMG
    kind load docker-image $IMG
    make deploy IMG=$IMG
    ```

1. Create `Password` CR

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f config/samples/secret_v1alpha1_password.yaml
    ```

1. Check Secret

    ```sh
    kubectl get secret
    NAME              TYPE     DATA   AGE
    password-sample   Opaque   1      5s
    ```

1. Check invalid CR (denied by admission webhook)

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: secret.example.com/v1alpha1
    kind: Password
    metadata:
      labels:
        app.kubernetes.io/name: password
        app.kubernetes.io/instance: password-sample
        app.kubernetes.io/part-of: password-operator
        app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kustomize
        app.kubernetes.io/created-by: password-operator
      name: password-sample
    spec:
      length: 20
      digit: 10
      symbol: 15
    ```

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f config/samples/secret_v1alpha1_password.yaml
    Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating "config/samples/secret_v1alpha1_password.yaml": admission webhook "vpassword.kb.io" denied the request: Number of digits and symbols must be less than total length
    ```

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

More information can be found via the [Kubebuilder Documentation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/introduction.html)

### Recreate with new kubebuilder version

Example:

```
echo yes | SED=gsed ./.upgrade-version.sh v3.12.0
```
